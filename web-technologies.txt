JAVASCRIPT

html - defines content of webpages
css  - defines layout of webpages
js - programs the behaviour of webpages


Who created?
	js - by brendan eich, has ecma standard

EcmaScript
	ecmascipt is official version of js

Scripting Lang
	js is the default scripting language of html,
	so no need to write <script type="text/javascript">

Where can we place js?
	head and body
	better to place scripts at bottom of body, since script compilation might slow the display.
	external js files, when used across many webpages, better.

advantage of external js file?
	separation of html and code
	caching js files, speeds up loading of webpage
	easier to read and maintain

writing / printing using js?
	does not have print/write function builtin,
	it uses window.alert() OR document.write() OR document.getElementById().innerHTML OR console.log()

who executes javascript programs?
	the browsers execute javascript programs.

js statements
	are instructions to be executed by the browser.

js comments	
	// or /* */

js variables
	if we dont initialize a variable, the value of a variable will be 'undefined'
		var x; if we use x somewhere, the value will be undefined

re-delaring javascript variables
	var x = "volvo"; var x;
	x retains its value.

concat num with strings
	if we concat num to a string, its treated as a string.

js operators
	typeof - type ==> typeof x
	. - member ==> person.name
	[] - member ==> person["name"]
	** - exponentiation ==> 10**3
	=== - strict equal ==> x === y
	!== - strict unequal ==> x !== y

js - dynamic types
	same variable can hold values of  different datatypes.
	var x = 16;
	x = "John"

js - arrays
	var arr = [1,2,3,4];
	var strarr = ["a", "b", "c"]

js - objects
	var obj = {firstName:"raja", lastName="rani", age=33};

js - emptying a value
	var obj = undefined

js - null // null is a object type.
	var obj = null

js - diff between null & undefined
	typeof undefined // undefine
	typeof null // object
